% data_preprocess
% Collection of sample data pre-processing codes that may be applied to
% data prior to noise analysis and tilt/compliance correction. This script
% will apply the pre-processing steps and save the data in an appropriate
% file structure.
% Pre-procssing steps included here are:
%  - Downsampling
%  - Response Removal
%  - Gain Adjustment
% Each may be included or excluded depending on the needs of the user.
